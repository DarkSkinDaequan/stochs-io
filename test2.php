        <p> This is an article about a cult discovered in Ephesus from the department of history at California State University, Fullerton. 
           The cult of Artemis Ephesia gets much of its mystical dominance from the Paleolithic age to the Neapolitan age largely depicted by belief systems proliferated by pressures of their society. These influences, such as territory, imagery and iconography, and aesthetics which are rigorously viewed based upon archeological evidence have wide insight into Artemis being seen as a goddess with economic and sociopolitical influence. Artemis was not considered a ruler, apart from her statues having a comparatively large frame and representing goddess characteristics, but instead what followed from her influence was mostly a ritually based sophistication that dominated Ephesus. For example, their monetary system heavily relied on coins, of which represented Artemis’s economic involvement, roughly dating back to B.C, that further show more of her worship especially in places where deities often dominated social identity. There are several images leading to possible instances where it has not been decided whether or not the goddess had been informed of these cultural characterizations, but the mysticality of the cult of the goddess demonstrates its establishment in society and its impact on the geographical surroundings. Stored in the imagery of her cult were not mere plaster, but instead, widespread beauty found throughout the age. This femininity was shown in an image portraying Artmesis sitting down having long breasts with wide arms which were two feet from her shoulder exemplifying features of a goddess. Notably, the former differs from the conservative view that elucidates statues and figurarines’ have mostly masculine characteristics and that this emphasis on the body and arms is possibly pornographic. In contrast, the imagery reflects the material culture of the time as seen by the type of compositions of the statue mostly wood, gold, silver, etc attributed by the goddesses' heavenly cult-image and further evidence reveals the cultural depth of the cult connecting to the heavens as viewed from Rome dating back to BCE when a small clerk attributed the mythical result to femininity with implications to Artemis. Although, in Acts of the Apostles, Paul claims that the iconography at the time in Rome obtrusively may not fully be representative of the heavens despite much of the magic found in the cult-like image. This argument is maintained because the popularity of the goddess in Phrygia in comparison to Rome leads to differences affirming the clerk’s response that supports the characteristics of Greek gods clearly and elucidating femininity. Although some scholars still rely on the conservative belief and highlight the reconstruction of military and sequences that took place mostly due to the impact of war that took place in. In this context, despite the former view, evidence shows that the people, of which were mostly women coming into South India, mostly shared an egalitarian belief that governed the gender roles of time as opposed to the militant, patriarchal and matriarchal ideology.
